# BRDF measurement

We are currently working on a project to measure the BRDF of an Aluminum plate. The purpose of my code is to capture a set of pictures of the surface from a fixed angle and calculate the radiance from the surface of the Aluminum base on the pictures we get. Then get radiance data from different angles and fit them with the Cook-Torrance BRDF model.
